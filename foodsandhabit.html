						<p>Eating healthy foods is not about strict dietary limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. <br>
	Rather, it is about feeling great, improving your outlook, having energy, make up your skin and stabilizing your mood. <br>
	If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you are not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells <br>
	you a certain food is good for you, you will find another saying exactly the opposite. But by using these simple tips, you can cut through the <br>
	confusion and learn how to create a tasty, varied, and healthy diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.</p>

		<h3>Apple</h3>
		<p>The apple is high in fiber, vitamin C and numerous antioxidants. Apples are very fulfilling, <br>
		and perfect as snacks if you find yourself hungry between meals.</p>
		<h3>Brown Rice</h3>
		<p>Rice is one of the oldest cereal grains, and is currently a staple food for more than half of people in the world. <br>
		Brown (whole grain) rice is fairly nutritious, with a decent amount of fiber, vitamin B1 and magnesium.</p>
		<h3>Whole Milk</h3>
		<p>Whole milk is very high in vitamins, minerals, quality animal protein and healthy fats. It is one of the best sources of calcium.</p>
		<h3>Yoghurt</h3>
		<p>Yogurt is made from milk that is fermented by adding live bacteria to it. It has many of the same health effects as milk, <br>
		except with the added benefits of the friendly probiotic bacteria.</p>
		<h3>Oats</h3>
		<p>Oats are incredibly healthy. They are loaded with nutrients, and also contain powerful fibers called beta-glucans, <br>
		shown to have numerous benefits.</p>

		<h3>Always have a plan</h3>
		<p>It's easy to get sucked into the lure of the restaurant menu when you're hungry and everything looks good. <br>
		Order what likes to eat, but balance the meal out with the rest of the day. If you know you're going out for a steak and potatoes dinner, <br>
		go easy on the meat and starch at lunch. Make sure you're also fitting in healthy fare like whole grains, fruit, veggies, <br>
		and nuts and seeds in the other meals and snacks that day.</P>
		<h3>Don't eat boring foods</h3>
		<p>Nutritionists are always saying to eat more vegetables, so cook them in a way that takes them from ho-hum to yum. <br>
		Always incorporate high-flavor add-ons to jazz up veggies, like sauteing with olive oil and garlic, <br>
		or spraying them with olive oil before throwing them in an oven with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. <br>
		That way, you don't equate "healthy" with "tasteless," a mindset that will knock you off the veggie bandwagon fast.</p>
		<h3>Eat lunch like a king</h3>
		<p>As for everyone make breakfast the meal of your day. But actually when awake normally not that much hungry always. <br>
		And also you do not need a huge meal for the dinner time. At lunch emphasize protein and greens, <br>
		like a hearty bowl of lentil soup and kale salad.</p>
